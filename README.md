## Light-weight Deformable Registration using Adversarial Learning with Distilling Knowledge

Repo for our **LDR-ALDK** proposal.

**Abstract:** 
Deformable  registration  is  a  crucial  step  inmany  medical  procedures  such  as  image-guided  surgeryand radiation therapy. Most of recent learning-based meth-ods focus on improving the accuracy by optimizing the non-linear  spatial  correspondence  between  the  input  images.Therefore,  these  methods  are  computationally  expensiveand require modern graphic cards for real-time deployment.In this paper, we introduce a new Light-weight DeformableRegistration network that significantly reduces the compu-tational cost while achieving competitive accuracy. In par-ticular, we propose a new adversarial learning with distillingknowledge algorithm that successfully leverages meaning-ful information from the effective but expensive teacher net-work to the student network. We design the student networksuch as it is light-weight and well suitable for deploymenton a normal CPU. The extensively experimental results ondifferent public datasets show that our proposed methodachieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly fasterthan recent methods. We further show that the use of adver-sarial  learning  algorithm  is  essential  for  a  time-efficiencydeformable  registration  method.
